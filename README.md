## üöÄ Key Features

* **Real-Time Monitoring:** Scans **NewsAPI**, **RSS Feeds** (industry-specific), **Google News**, and **Reddit** for brand and competitor mentions within user-defined timeframes (up to 30 days). Includes fallback dummy data for other social platforms.
* **AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes **Amazon Bedrock** (Anthropic Claude models with sequential fallback) to analyze mentions, classifying them beyond simple positive/negative into nuanced tones like `mixed`, `anger`, and `appreciation`. Keyword analysis serves as a robust fallback.
* **Comprehensive KPI Dashboard:** Visualizes key metrics crucial for PR success:
    * **Media Impact Score (MIS):** Weighted score based on source authority.
    * **Message Penetration Index (MPI):** Tracks how well campaign messages appear in mentions.
    * **Sentiment Ratio:** Detailed breakdown of sentiment tones.
    * **Share of Voice (SOV):** Compares brand visibility against competitors.
    * **Average Social Engagement:** Tracks likes/comments/upvotes from social sources (Reddit & dummy data).
    * **Total Reach:** Estimated audience size based on source reach.
    * *(Thresholds for MPI & Engagement are user-configurable in the sidebar)*.
* **Competitive Tracking:** Allows monitoring of the primary brand alongside user-defined competitors.
* **Keyword & Phrase Extraction:** Identifies trending topics and themes associated with mentions using NLTK.
* **Automated Reporting:** Generates professional **PDF summary reports** (including AI-generated executive summaries & recommendations) and detailed **Excel (.xlsx) files** containing all mention data with source links.
* **Intelligent Alert System:** Configurable alerts (via **Email** and **Slack**) and **ServiceNow** incident creation for significant spikes in negative sentiment.
* **Customizable Styling:** Features a custom dark theme with brand colors (Gold, Black, Beige).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/flash-narrative.git](https://github.com/your-username/flash-narrative.git)
    cd flash-narrative
    ```

2.  **Create Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: `playwright` might be listed but isn't actively used by the current scrapers. `facebook-scraper` is also listed but only dummy data is generated.)*

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
    * Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if provided) or add the following, replacing placeholders with your actual keys/credentials:

        ```dotenv
        # NewsAPI (REQUIRED for real news data)
        NEWSAPI_KEYS=YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY_1,YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY_2 # Comma-separated if multiple

        # AWS Bedrock (REQUIRED for AI analysis)
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY
        AWS_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY
        AWS_REGION=us-east-1 # Or your preferred Bedrock-enabled region

        # Email for Reports/Alerts (REQUIRED for email features)
        SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com # Or smtp.office365.com, etc.
        SMTP_PORT=587
        SMTP_USER=your_email@example.com
        SMTP_PASS=your_app_password # Use Google/Outlook App Password if 2FA is enabled

        # Slack Alerts (Optional)
        SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-your-slack-bot-token

        # ServiceNow Integration (Optional)
        SERVICENOW_INSTANCE=your_instance_name # e.g., dev12345
        SERVICENOW_USER=your_servicenow_user
        SERVICENOW_PASSWORD=your_servicenow_password

        # Other Settings
        SCRAPER_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=15
        ALERT_EMAIL=email_for_crisis_alerts@yourcompany.com # Email used by send_alert
        ```
    * **IMPORTANT:** Ensure you have enabled model access in the AWS Bedrock console for the models listed in `bedrock.py` within your specified `AWS_REGION`.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

6.  **Login:** Use the default credentials `user` / `pass` (defined in `app.py`).

## üìñ How It Works

1.  **Input:** User enters Brand Name, Competitors, Industry, Campaign Messages, and Time Frame on the Streamlit dashboard.
2.  **Scraping:** The `scraper.py` module fetches mentions from NewsAPI, RSS feeds, Google News, and Reddit based on the inputs. Dummy data is generated for other social platforms.
3.  **AI Analysis:** For each mention, `bedrock.py` calls the Amazon Bedrock API (trying models sequentially) to determine sentiment (`get_llm_sentiment`). If all Bedrock models fail, `analysis.py` uses keyword matching (`analyze_sentiment_keywords`) as a fallback.
4.  **KPI Calculation:** `analysis.py` processes the raw data and sentiments to calculate MIS, MPI, SOV, Engagement Rate, Reach, and Sentiment Ratios (`compute_kpis`), and extracts top keywords/phrases (`extract_keywords`).
5.  **Display:** `pages/dashboard.py` renders the KPIs (with threshold styling), interactive charts (Plotly), and data tables (Pandas DataFrames).
6.  **Reporting:** On request, `report_gen.py` creates a PDF summary using ReportLab (including an AI-generated summary from Bedrock via `generate_llm_report_summary`) and an Excel file of all mentions using Pandas/Openpyxl.
7.  **Alerting:** If negative sentiment exceeds a threshold, `servicenow_integration.py` sends alerts via Slack/Email and creates a ServiceNow ticket. Email functionality is also used for sending generated reports.
